        <h3 class="aboutTitle">The Who</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">I am a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science in 
            Graphic Information Technology, focussed on Full Stack Development... Which is just a really
            long way of saying I like to draw and work with computers. For the last 15 or so years I have been fully
            invested in anything and everything technology. I guess you could say it's passion! Whether it's 
            videography, building a new system, end-user support, or graphic design I always give it my all.
            Computers and technology has been a part of my life ever since I was a small... well, smaller, kid.
            Over the last 10 years I have devled into the world of Graphic Design and Web Development;
            developing responsive web applications. If I'm not working on a comissioned project, you'll likely
            find me knee deep in code working on a personal project, drawing, or just gaming online with old 
            friends!
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">The Spark!</h3>

        <p class="aboutText"> Ever since I was little I can remember being glued to the computer. I spent countless 
            hours online playing popular MMORPGs such as Runescape. Since we're being honest, I still
            play too much Runescape. At six years old I remember surfing the web for various videogame guides,
            playthroughs, other games that I could play... anything related to the games I was interested in 
            at the time. Being online since I young age has given me front row access to the ever changing
            landscape that is the internet. As I grew I started to become more interested in the how and the 
            why of programs.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">A Life Long Endevour</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">I disctinctly remember when I was around 8 years old being shown AOL mail for the first time.
            My Mother had called me downstairs to the family computer and proceeded to type out a short
            message and click the send button. At the time I had absolutely no idea what was going on. Not
            2 minutes later we heard the traditional 'You got mail!' tone from AOL, and saw a new message
            in my mother's inbox. Opening the message revealed a response to my mother's origional message
            from my Grandmother who lived a few blocks down the street. I was absolutely flabbergasted. 
            Sure, I had spent more hours than any kid should have on the computer, talking with friends in 
            real time on the game, but I had never put it together that I could use this technology to talk
            with friends and family that didn't play videogames online.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">Shortly after this interaction with AOL mail I became more interested in how exactly email
            and the internet worked. How was it that I could send a message into the void and receive a 
            response almost instantly? How does running an installation disk instal a program on your computer?
            I was determined to find out, some way or another. A few years later my older brother had bought 
            his first 'gaming' pc. As his little brother, I just had to have one for myself. So, over the following 
            months I saved up for my own. With 500$ in hand we made a trip to the local Fry's Electronics
            and put together a muppit of a computer, but it was my first and I enjoyed every minute of 
            that agonizing weekend putting it together. And as the saying goes, the rest is history.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">Creative Beginnings</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">In highschool I was never much of an artistic kid. I took drama class, but art was not on the tables
            for me. However, during my senior year two of my close friends took the class and I became hooked.
            At the time I would go home from school and spend hours learning to draw; even tracing pictures
            to make myself feel better. Little did I know, this small habbit would shape the future of my college career.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">During my first year of college I studied at Colorado State Univeristy as a Graphic Design major.
            Being so far from home and trying to learn a new skill was very difficult for me and I ended up moving back
            in with my parents. That being said, I had no intention of giving up on my dream. The following year I 
            started attending Arizona State Univeristy's online course for Graphic Design. Through a chance
            conversation with my old Colorado roomate, I discovered my love of coding. That friend ended up
            pushing me to following my interestes, and as a result I started my new major in Graphic Information
            Technology. 
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">From Design to Development</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">Although I started as a Graphic Design major, I was easily able to transition into Graphic Information Technology.
            Applying my ever expanding design skills to my code I was able to expand my horizons by learning 
            how to not only design responsive webpages, but also how to hand code those pages from scratch. During 
            my studies I learned how to create responsive, interactive, and applealing web applications with 
            intuative user design.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">Plans for the Future</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">With my college degree behind me, it was time to start development! Currently, my main 
            focus of work developing my skills. This website itself is an example of my current abilities. 
            This website, as well as the collection of projects included have all been hand developed by 
            myself unless specifically stated in the project description. 
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">Looking to the future, I plan on continuing to develop responsive and interactive web pages and applications.
            Along side the other project included in this website I am also developing a recipe website to
            store all of my personal favorites, family, and personal recipes. Once completed, the site will
            accessible from this page for free use if desired.  
        </p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">How You Can Help</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">As a fresh graduate, most of my time is spent working on these projects to improve my skills.
            Development takes time to be perfect, and often times requires long nights and a flexible schedule.
            If you would like to see more of my work, would like to support me financially, or hire me 
            for a project, you can do so by reaching out to me directly, or through the contact page.
