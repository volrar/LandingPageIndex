                        seamless front- and back-end applications. I emphasize smooth transitions, device

        <p class="aboutText">Take a scroll down to explore my journey through technology, education, and 
            hands-on experience. Each chapter has shaped the skills and perspective I bring to
             my work today.</p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">The Who</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">
            I’m a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a Bachelor of Science in Graphic 
            Information Technology, focused on Full Stack Development—basically, a fancy way of 
            saying I love to draw and work with computers. For the past 15 years, I’ve been fully 
            immersed in all things tech—it’s more than a hobby; it’s a passion. Whether it’s videography, 
            building custom systems, end-user support, or graphic design, I always give it my all. Computers 
            and technology have been part of my life since I was a little (well, smaller) kid.
            Over the last decade, I’ve dived deeper into the worlds of graphic design and web 
            development, building responsive web applications. When I’m not working on a commissioned 
            project, you’ll probably find me knee-deep in code on a personal project, sketching new 
            ideas, or gaming online with old friends!

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">The Spark!</h3>

        <p class="aboutText"> Ever since I was little, I’ve been glued to a computer. 
            I’ve spent countless hours online playing popular MMORPGs like RuneScape—and 
            to be honest, I still play way too much RuneScape.
            By the time I was six, I was already scouring the web for game guides, 
            playthroughs, and anything else related to the games I was into at the moment. Growing 
            up online gave me a front-row seat to the ever-changing landscape of the internet. As I 
            got older, my curiosity shifted—I found myself becoming more interested in how things 
            worked and why programs were built the way they were.</p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">A Life Long Endevour</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">
            I distinctly remember being around eight years old when I was shown AOL Mail for 
            the first time. My mom called me downstairs to the family computer, typed out a short 
            message, and hit send. At the time, I had no idea what was happening.
            Less than two minutes later, we heard the iconic “You’ve got mail!” tone 
            from AOL, and a new message appeared in my mom’s inbox. Opening it revealed a response 
            from my grandmother, who lived just a few blocks away. I was completely floored.</p>

        <p class="aboutText">
            I had already spent more hours than any kid should on the computer, chatting with friends 
            in real time through games. But it hadn’t clicked until that moment—this same technology 
            could be used to connect with friends and family who weren’t part of the online gaming world.
            Shortly after my first experience with AOL Mail, I became 
            fascinated with how email and the internet actually worked. How could I send a 
            message into the void and get a response almost instantly? How did running an 
            installation disk put a program on my computer? I was determined to figure it all out, 
            one way or another.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">A few years later, my older brother bought his first gaming PC. 
            Naturally, as the younger brother, I had to have one too. So, over the next few months, 
            I saved up every dollar I could. With $500 in hand, we made a trip to the local Fry’s 
            Electronics and built a mismatched Frankenstein of a computer. It was far from perfect, 
            but it was mine—and I loved every agonizing minute of putting it together that weekend.
            AOL's instant messaging was my spark, but this point on I was hooked.

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">Creative Beginnings</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">In high school, I was never much of an artistic kid. 
            I took drama class, but art wasn’t really on my radar. That changed during my 
            senior year when two of my close friends took an art class—and I got hooked.
             I started going home after school and spending hours learning to draw, even 
             tracing pictures just to boost my confidence. Little did I know, this small habit 
             would end up shaping the course of my college career.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">During my first year of college, I studied Graphic Design at Colorado 
            State University. Being so far from home while trying to learn a new skill was tough, and 
            I eventually moved back in with my parents. But even then, I had no intention of giving 
            up on my dream.The following year, I enrolled in Arizona State University’s online    
            Graphic Design program. Through a chance conversation with my former Colorado 
            roommate, I discovered my love for coding. That friend encouraged me to pursue my 
            interests, and before long, I switched my major to Graphic Information Technology.</p>

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">From Design to Development</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">Although I started as a Graphic Design major, transitioning into 
            Graphic Information Technology felt like a natural shift. I was able to apply my growing 
            design skills to my coding, expanding my horizons by learning not only how to design 
            responsive web pages but also how to hand-code them from scratch.
            Throughout my studies, I developed the skills to create responsive, interactive, and 
            visually appealing web applications with intuitive user design.

        <h3 class="aboutTitle">Plans for the Future</h3>

        <p class="aboutText">With my college degree behind me, it’s time to dive into development! 
            Right now, my primary focus is on refining my skills. This website is a reflection of my 
            current abilities—everything you see here, along with the projects showcased, has been 
            hand-developed by me unless otherwise noted in the project descriptions.
        </p>

        <p class="aboutText">Looking ahead, I plan to continue building responsive and interactive 
            web pages and applications. In addition to the projects featured here, I’m also working 
            on a recipe website to store my personal favorites, as well as family recipes. Once it’s

            to sharpen my skills. Development takes time to get just right, often requiring late
